			<response>Hey! Josh is offline as he's at ESA Winter 2020 https://esamarathon.com/schedule (He's running SA twice!). While he's gone he probably won't stream, in the meantime you can watch Emma do her first SA playthrough! https://www.twitch.tv/kitteamuz Josh will be back Tuesday 25th</response>
